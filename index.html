	<p><strong>COURSE SUBJECTS</strong></p>
	<h4>C Programming</h4>
	I started learning C and C++ in my first year of graduation. <br>
	Therefore ,the basics are well known . I have code many programs <br>
	in C++ language .From MANIT, c programming as a core subjects it<br>
	is my expectation that I will be an expert in the same language and<br>
	apart from basics, I will get to know more interesting facts about the<br>
	language and excess in coding in the same language.<br>

	<h4>Computer Organisation and Architecture</h4>
	This subject seems to be really interesting as it provides us with the<br>
	knowledge of how computer actually works internally. With this subject, I<br>
	expect that I will be able to understand and imbibe more deeper concepts on <br>
	Computer architecture and its organisation.<br>

	<h4>Data Structure</h4>
	Though this subject is very interesting but at the same time it is very complex<br>
	and difficult. I have learned the basic concepts in my graduation years but now<br>
	its important to implement its every topic with much more understanding. I hope that <br>
	teachers and my classmates of MANIT will help me to do so very well. Since the subject<br>
	has its great importance in interviews also I hope i will be able to crack those<br>
	interviews as well.<br>
	
	<h4>Web Development</h4>
	This subject is my favourite because somehow it relates to designing webpages.<br>
	Before making this page honestly I haven't made any web page of this level. But with these<br>
	assignments, I am able to implement all that I know about html and css . Assignments given by<br>
	teachers of all the subjects proved to be really helpful for me. I hope this semester I can say<br>
	myself atleast a good front end developer.<br>

	<h4>Mathematics</h4>
	Mathematics in MCA is new to me. I haven't done this because I have done bsc in computer science <br>
	so it was a minor subject. In MANIT ,I will focus on this subject as well .<br>
	
	<h4>Operating System</h4>
	I know only basics of opearting system and I hope that in this semester only i will be able to make this <br>
	subject strong with the teacher of MANIT.<br><hr>
